# Láthos: Chronicles of Dásos

## About the Project

This video game project was made as part of our DDJD course at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto. The students are from 2 different courses: 

- MEIC (Master in Informatics and Computing Engineering)
- Multimedia / Sound Design

### Technical Details

Game Engine: Unity 2022.3.20f1

## The Story

In an island called Dásos, engulfed by eternal darkness, the lone hero, armed with a companion magical lamp, sets out to reclaim the stolen light from malevolent insect creatures, confronting the island's darkest secrets to restore radiance to its desolate homeland. Guided by the flickering flame and driven by a quest for revenge, the hero battles through waves of darkness, facing off against the dark insect forces and their ruler to bring hope back to the once-vibrant island.

### Player Classes 

The player starts the game with a base class which just has a basic attack. After the 2nd section, the player is able to choose one of the three major branches (that define which of the three endings the player will unlock) and in the 4th section, each of these classes branches into two possible sub-classes.

## Game Level Design

The game is composed of 6 sections. The first 5 are maze-like dark forests where many enemies
spawn and are sequential. The last one is a boss fight in a big open area surrounded by trees. The
top-down view of the maps can be seen below
