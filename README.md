## About the Project

This game is being developed by students for a university course project. The students are from 2 different courses:

## The Story

In an island called D치sos, engulfed by eternal darkness, the lone hero Ithi치, armed with a companion magical lamp, sets out to reclaim the stolen light from malevolent insect creatures, confronting the island's darkest secrets to restore radiance to its desolate homeland. Guided by the flickering flame and driven by a quest for revenge, the hero battles through waves of darkness, facing off against the dark insect forces and their ruler to bring hope back to the once-vibrant island.
